## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to the project, we are excited to have your input.
The following guidelines should be observed by contributors:

* Please follow the contributor [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/shader-slang/slang/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
* Bugs reports and feature requests should go through the GitHub issue tracker
* Changes should ideally come in as small pull requests on top of `master`, coming from your own personal fork of the project
* Large features that will involve multiple contributors or a long development time should be discussed in issues, and broken down into smaller pieces that can be implemented and checked in in stages

[Contribution guide](https://github.com/shader-slang/slang/CONTRIBUTION.md) describes the workflow for contributors in more detail.
